## General Information
 A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. 
 The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. 
 For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.  

 The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. 
 Expectation is to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties, 
 and decide whether to invest in them or not.The company wants to know:
 
 Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
 How well those variables describe the price of a house.
